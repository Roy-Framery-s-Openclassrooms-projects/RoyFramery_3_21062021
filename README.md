## Description 📓 

![Légende](https://github.com/Roy-Framery-s-Openclassrooms-projects/RoyFramery_3_21062021/blob/dev/public/images/maquettes_Ohmyfood.png)

__*ohmyfood*__ is the third project I made during this training. As a junior developer, the goal 🎯 was to integrate the mobile mock up of a website which list restaurants' menues by using only HTML and CSS. For this, I had a briefing that notice me some features and contraints to integrate : 

### Contraints and Features
- Using __*Shrikhand*__ font for Logo and Titles and __*Roboto*__ font for general text
- Using a color chart : *__#9356DC__*, __*#FF79DA*__, __*#99E2D0*__
- I was __*free*__ to choose the responsive design for __*tablet*__ 📱 and __*desktop*__ 💻
- I couldn't use __*JavaScript*__ and any __*frameworks*__, but I can use __*Sass*__
- The site must be compatible with the __*last*__ desktop versions of __*Chrome*__ and __*Firefox*__
- __*Display*__ the __*location*__ 📍 of the restaurants 
- the footer must be __*identical*__ on all pages 
- The Header must be __*identical*__ on all pages, but on the menu's page, It __*also*__ contains a button to __*return*__ to the __*home page*__
### Animations 
- button : 
  * On hover, the background color of the main buttons should be __*lighter*__ 🔆 and the shadow __*more visible*__
  * Add a *__heart-shaped__* "Like" button 💜. On hover, it will have to be __*gradually fill up*__
- Home page : 
  * Integrate a loading spinner and show an __*overview*__ by défine a animation duration between 1 and 3 seconds. The design is not defined and have to __*respect the graphic charter*__ of the site.
- Menu pages :
    * the dishes should appear __*gradually*__ with a slight __*time lag*__ ⌛
    * The visitor can add the dishes he wants to his order by clicking on them. A small tick __*appears to the right*__ of the dish that __*slides from right to left*__ and if the title of the dish is too long, it will have to be __*trimmed with suspension points*__.
